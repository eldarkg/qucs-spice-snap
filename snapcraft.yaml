summary: Quite Universal Circuit Simulator
description: |
  Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to setup
  a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the large-signal,
  small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. After that simulation has
  finished you can view the simulation results on a presentation page or window.
  Supports spice simulators.
